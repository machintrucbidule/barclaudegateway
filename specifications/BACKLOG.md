# BarclaudeGateway — Active Backlog

> The **active** backlog: only items **not yet developed**. Items are organized into priority-ordered
> batches — the top batch is the next to develop (run loop prompt 2 on it). When an item ships, it
> moves to [`BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md`](./BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md). Keep this file clean: no done items here.
>
> Driven by the three reusable loop prompts in [`prompts/`](./prompts/):
> [intake/triage](./prompts/loop-1-intake-triage.md) · [develop a batch](./prompts/loop-2-develop-batch.md) ·
> [ops/grooming](./prompts/loop-3-ops-grooming.md). Schema and process: [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) §
> "Iterative maintenance loop".
>
> Last updated: 2026-06-28 (**BATCH-5** [BL-006] shipped — configurable auth-token policy (lazy vs
> keep-alive); moved to `BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md`. **No actionable batch remains** — run loop prompt 1 to
> add new remarks.)

- Source: user remark (YYYY-MM-DD) | verification check | incident
- Spec impact: none | contract.md §X | PROJECT_CONTEXT.md | decisions.md (DECISION-XXX)
- Affected files / areas: <paths or subsystems>
- Description: what is wrong or wanted, and why (plain language)
- Change to make: the concrete development work — enough detail to implement directly
- Acceptance criteria: how we confirm it is done
- Batch: BATCH-X | standalone
- Dependencies: BL-NNN, … (or none)

## (No actionable batch)

The active backlog is empty. Run [loop prompt 1](./prompts/loop-1-intake-triage.md) to capture and
triage new remarks into a batch, then [loop prompt 2](./prompts/loop-2-develop-batch.md) to develop it.
