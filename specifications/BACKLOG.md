# BarclaudeGateway — Active Backlog

> The **active** backlog: only items **not yet developed**. Items are organized into priority-ordered
> batches — the top batch is the next to develop (run loop prompt 2 on it). When an item ships, it
> moves to [`BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md`](./BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md). Keep this file clean: no done items here.
>
> Driven by the three reusable loop prompts in [`prompts/`](./prompts/):
> [intake/triage](./prompts/loop-1-intake-triage.md) · [develop a batch](./prompts/loop-2-develop-batch.md) ·
> [ops/grooming](./prompts/loop-3-ops-grooming.md). Schema and process: [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) §
> "Iterative maintenance loop".
>
> Last updated: 2026-06-28 (**BATCH-6** [BL-007] shipped — lazy mode no longer force-fetches the
> shopping lists on the config page; moved to `BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md`. The active backlog is now **empty**.)

- Affected files / areas: <paths or subsystems>
- Description: what is wrong or wanted, and why (plain language)

## No active batches

The active backlog is empty — every triaged item has shipped (see
[`BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md`](./BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md)). Run
[loop prompt 1 (intake/triage)](./prompts/loop-1-intake-triage.md) to add new remarks.
